Commit 1
Created the class SecretNumber and the variables within. 
Initialized the values of the variable in the Initialize method and returned the values in the constructor method SecretNumber

Commit 2
Created the method MakeGuess with a little bit of testing. 
Still need to sort the counting of the guesses to go negative from 7.

Commit 3
Fixed the remaining guesses to count correctly
